description: A template for building and publishing your own shadcn registry components.
---

A **ready-to-use template** for creating and publishing custom components to the [shadcn registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry).

## What You Get

- 📦 **Simple structure** - One component file + one config file
- 📚 **Documentation site** - Powered by Fumadocs
- 🎨 **Registry compatible** - Works with `npx shadcn add`
- 🚀 **Deploy ready** - One-click Vercel deployment

## How It Works

```
registry/
└── new-york/
    └── your-component.tsx   ← Your component

registry.json                ← Component metadata
```

When you run `pnpm registry:build`, it generates files in `public/r/` that the shadcn CLI can install from.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Fork this template on GitHub

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Edit your component
# → registry/new-york/your-component.tsx

# 4. Update registry.json with your component details

# 5. Build & run
pnpm registry:build
pnpm dev
```

Once deployed, users install your component with:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://your-site.vercel.app/r/your-component.json
```
